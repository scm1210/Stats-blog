Hi!

My name is Steven Mesquiti! I'm a [first-year](https://lemolab.princeton.edu/people/steven-mesquiti) in the Department of Psychology at Princeton University advised by [Erik Nook](https://lemolab.princeton.edu/people/erik-c-nook-phd).

I study how we can use Natural Language Processing techniques and Artifical Intelligence to explain, predict, and improve people's Mental Health.

Before Princeton, I worked as a Lab Manager for Emily Falk in the [Communication Neuroscience Lab](https://www.asc.upenn.edu/research/centers/communication-neuroscience-lab) at the Univeristy of Pennsylvania. Along the way, I have worked with excessively generous scientists like Jamie Pennebaker, Lyle Ungar, & Angela Duckworth pursing questions at the nexus of Computer Science, Computational Linguistics, and Psychology

This is my blog for `PSY-504`. You can find various assignments that I complete on this website.
