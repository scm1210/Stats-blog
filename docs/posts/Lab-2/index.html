<ul>
<li><p>Assignment requirements:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>If you are using Github (recommended), make sure to commit and push your work to GitHub regularly, at least after each exercise. Write short and informative commit messages, and share the link to your assignment with me. If not, you can also send me the <strong>rmd</strong> &amp; <strong>rendered file</strong> via Canvas.</p></li>
<li><p>In this assignment, you will not need to code from scratch. Rather, you’ll need to fill in code where needed. This assignment has a logisitic regression implementation for a scenario from EDA down to model comparison (and would be useful for whenever you may encounter such a situation in the future).</p></li>
<li><p>I want the assignments to begin reflecting a bit more of how you’d be doing things on your own, where you have some prior knowledge and you figure other things out (by referring to documentation, etc.) . In addition to the rmd, I also want you to submit to me <strong>notes</strong> of anything new that you learn while finishing the assignment. And any pain-points, and we’ll discuss more.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Note:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>If you are fitting a model, display the model output in a neatly formatted table. (The <code>gt</code> <code>tidy</code> and <code>kable</code> functions can help!). <code>Modelsummary</code> also looks good(https://vincentarelbundock.github.io/modelsummary/articles/modelsummary.html)</p></li>
<li><p>Make sure that your plots are clearly labeled – for all axes, titles, etc.<br>
</p></li>
</ul></li>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="data-general-social-survey">Data: General Social Survey</h2>
<p>The General Social Survey (GSS) has been used to measure trends in attitudes and behaviors in American society since 1972. In addition to collecting demographic information, the survey includes questions used to gauge attitudes about government spending priorities, confidence in institutions, lifestyle, and many other topics. A full description of the survey may be found here.</p>
<p>The data for this lab are from the 2016 General Social Survey. The original data set contains 2867 observations and 935 variables. We will use and abbreviated data set that includes the following variables:</p>
<p>natmass: Respondent’s answer to the following prompt:</p>
<p>“We are faced with many problems in this country, none of which can be solved easily or inexpensively. I’m going to name some of these problems, and for each one I’d like you to tell me whether you think we’re spending too much money on it, too little money, or about the right amount…are we spending too much, too little, or about the right amount on mass transportation?”</p>
<p>age: Age in years.</p>
<p>sex: Sex recorded as male or female</p>
<p>sei10: Socioeconomic index from 0 to 100</p>
<p>region: Region where interview took place</p>
<p>polviews: Respondent’s answer to the following prompt:</p>
<p>“We hear a lot of talk these days about liberals and conservatives. I’m going to show you a seven-point scale on which the political views that people might hold are arranged from extremely liberal - point 1 - to extremely conservative - point 7. Where would you place yourself on this scale?”</p>
<p>The data are in gss2016.csv in the data folder.</p>

<section id="eda" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="eda">EDA</h2>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Let’s begin by making a binary variable for respondents’ views on spending on mass transportation. Create a new variable that is equal to “1” if a respondent said spending on mass transportation is about right and “0” otherwise. Then plot the proportion of the response variable, using informative labels for each category.</p>

<p>If you did this right, you’ll find that being female (as compared to male) is associated with an increase in the log-odds of being satisfied with spending on mass transportation by 0.2557439 units (95% CI [0.09, 0.41]), holding all other variables constant. This equates to the odds of thinking the spending amount is right in females being 1.29 times the odds of thinking this in men (95% CI [1.13, 1.44]).</p>
<p>The predicted probability for females to be satisfied with spending on mass transportation is 55.9% (95% CI [53.3%, 58.5%]) and that of males is 49.5% (95% CI [46.7%, 52.4%]).<br>

<p>A one unit increase in SES index is associated with a decrease in the log-odds of being satisfied with spending on mass transportation by 0.0062 units (95% CI [-0.0107, -0.0017]), holding all other variables constant. The odds ratio is less than 1 (0.9937922), which confirms the negative relationship implied by the log-odds coefficient. Specifically, for each additional unit of SES index, the odds of being satisfied with mass transportation spending decrease by a factor of about 0.993, or approximately 0.7% per unit increase in SES index, holding other factors constant (95% CI [0.989, 0.998]).</p>
